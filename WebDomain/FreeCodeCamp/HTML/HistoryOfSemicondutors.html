      <h3>Timeline of evolution Semiconductors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1874</strong> - The foundation is laid by Karl Ferdinand Braun with the discovery of the "rectifier effect" in semiconductors, which allowed them to convert AC to DC current.
</li>
        <li><strong>Early 20th Century</strong> - Research on semiconductors continued, but their applications were limited.
The Birth of the Transistor</li>
        <li><strong>1947</strong> - The turning point arrives with the invention of the transistor by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Labs. This tiny device could amplify and switch electronic signals, replacing bulky and inefficient vacuum tubes.</li>
        <li><strong>1958</strong> - Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor independently invent the integrated circuit (IC), a single chip containing multiple transistors and other electronic components. This miniaturization paved the way for more complex and compact electronic devices.</li>
        <li><strong>1960s & 70s</strong> - Moore's Law, proposed by Gordon Moore, predicts that the number of transistors on a chip will double roughly every two years. This rapid pace of miniaturization drives the development of new and powerful electronic devices.
The Era of Microprocessors and Beyond</li>
        <li><strong>1971</strong> - The first commercially available microprocessor, the Intel 4004, is released. This programmable chip can execute instructions and forms the heart of modern computers.
</li>
        <li><strong>1980s</strong> - Present: Continued miniaturization and advancements in materials science lead to even more powerful and versatile ICs. We see the rise of personal computers, digital cameras, smartphones, and countless other electronic devices relying on these tiny wonders.
