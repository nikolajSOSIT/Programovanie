        <p>As you learnt in the previous tutorials, SFML's window module provides an easy way to open an OpenGL window and handle its events, but it doesn't help when it comes to drawing something. The only option which is left to you is to use the powerful, yet complex and low level OpenGL API.

Fortunately, SFML provides a graphics module which will help you draw 2D entities in a much simpler way than with OpenGL.</p></div>

            <h2>Shapes</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                There is a lot of shapes and even you can create your own.
                Set X and Y points as the edges of your desired shape.
                than add it like this:
            </p>
            <code>// create an empty shape
                sf::ConvexShape convex;
                
                // resize it to 5 points
                convex.setPointCount(5);
                
                // define the points
                convex.setPoint(0, sf::Vector2f(0.f, 0.f));
                convex.setPoint(1, sf::Vector2f(150.f, 10.f));
                convex.setPoint(2, sf::Vector2f(120.f, 90.f));
                convex.setPoint(3, sf::Vector2f(30.f, 100.f));
                convex.setPoint(4, sf::Vector2f(0.f, 50.f));</code>
            <p>There is and example of prebuilt shapes</p>
            <code>// define a triangle
                sf::CircleShape triangle(80.f, 3);
                
                // define a square
                sf::CircleShape square(80.f, 4);
                
                // define an octagon
                sf::CircleShape octagon(80.f, 8);</code>

                To draw the entities provided by the graphics module, you must use a specialized window class: sf::RenderWindow. This class is derived from sf::Window, and inherits all its functions. Everything that you've learnt about sf::Window (creation, event handling, controlling the framerate, mixing with OpenGL, etc.) is applicable to sf::RenderWindow as well.

On top of that, sf::RenderWindow adds high-level functions to help you draw things easily. In this tutorial we'll focus on two of these functions: clear and draw. They are as simple as their name implies: clear clears the whole window with the chosen color, and draw draws whatever object you pass to it.

Here is what a typical main loop looks like with a render window:
            </p>
            <code>#include SFML/Graphics.hpp

                int main()
                {
                    // create the window
                    sf::RenderWindow window(sf::VideoMode(800, 600), "My window");
                
                    // run the program as long as the window is open
                    while (window.isOpen())
                    {
                        // check all the window's events that were triggered since the last iteration of the loop
                        sf::Event event;
                        while (window.pollEvent(event))
                        {
                            // "close requested" event: we close the window
                            if (event.type == sf::Event::Closed)
                                window.close();
                        }
                
                        // clear the window with black color
                        window.clear(sf::Color::Black);
                
                        // draw everything here...
                        // window.draw(...);
                
                        // end the current frame
                        window.display();
                    }
                
                    return 0;
                }
            </code>

                This tutorial explains how to access global input devices: keyboard, mouse and joysticks. This must not be confused with events. Real-time input allows you to query the global state of keyboard, mouse and joysticks at any time ("is this button currently pressed?", "where is the mouse currently?") while events notify you when something happens ("this button was pressed", "the mouse has moved").
            </p>
            <code>
                if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::Left))
{
    // left key is pressed: move our character
    character.move(-1.f, 0.f);
}
            </code>
            <code>if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::Scan::Right))
                {
                    // right key is pressed: move our character
                    character.move(1.f, 0.f);
                }</code>
